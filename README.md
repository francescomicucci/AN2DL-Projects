## Project 1
**Topic:** Image Classification   
The aim of this project was to create a robust classification model for plants, distinguishing between their health statuses categorized as either healthy or unhealthy. This involved analyzing plant images with precision to accurately predict their health condition.

## Project 2
**Topic:** Time Series Forecasting  
This project centers around the creation of predictive models designed to forecast future data points within time series. Its primary objective is to develop forecasting models adept at leveraging past observations to accurately predict forthcoming values.
